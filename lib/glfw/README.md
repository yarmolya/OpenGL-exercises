## Introduction

GLFW is an Open Source, multi-platform library for OpenGL, OpenGL ES and Vulkan
application development.  It provides a simple, platform-independent API for
creating windows, contexts and surfaces, reading input, handling events, etc.

GLFW is written primarily in C99, with parts of macOS support being written in
Objective-C.

GLFW supports Windows, macOS and Linux, and also works on many other Unix-like
systems.  On Linux both Wayland and X11 are supported.

GLFW is licensed under the [zlib/libpng
license](https://www.glfw.org/license.html).

You can [download](https://www.glfw.org/download.html) the latest stable release
as source or Windows and macOS binaries.  There are [release
tags](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/releases) with source and binary archives
attached for every version since 3.0.

The [documentation](https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/) is available online and is
also included in source and binary archives, except those generated
automatically by Github.  The documentation contains guides, a tutorial and the
API reference.  The [release
notes](https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/news.html) list the new features,
caveats and deprecations in the latest release.  The [version
history](https://www.glfw.org/changelog.html) lists every user-visible change
for every release.

GLFW exists because of the contributions of [many people](CONTRIBUTORS.md)
around the world, whether by reporting bugs, providing community support, adding
features, reviewing or testing code, debugging, proofreading docs, suggesting
features or fixing bugs.


## System requirements

GLFW supports Windows 7 and later and macOS 10.11 and later.  On GNOME Wayland,
window decorations will be very basic unless the
[libdecor](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libdecor/libdecor) package is
installed.  Linux and other Unix-like systems running X11 are supported even
without a desktop environment or modern extensions, although some features
require a clipboard manager or a modern window manager.

See the [compatibility guide](https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compat.html)
for more detailed information.


## Compiling GLFW

GLFW supports compilation with Visual C++ (2013 and later), GCC and Clang.  Both
Clang-CL and MinGW-w64 are supported.  Other C99 compilers will likely also
work, but this is not regularly tested.

There are [pre-compiled binaries](https://www.glfw.org/download.html)
available for Windows and macOS.

GLFW itself needs only CMake and the headers and libraries for your operating
system and window system.  No other SDKs are required.

See the [compilation guide](https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compile.html) for
more information about compiling GLFW and the exact dependencies required for
each window system.

The examples and test programs depend on a number of tiny libraries.  These are
bundled in the `deps/` directory.  The repository has no submodules.

 - [getopt\_port](https://github.com/kimgr/getopt_port/) for examples
   with command-line options
 - [TinyCThread](https://github.com/tinycthread/tinycthread) for threaded
   examples
 - [glad2](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad) for loading OpenGL and Vulkan
   functions
 - [linmath.h](https://github.com/datenwolf/linmath.h) for linear algebra in
   examples
 - [Nuklear](https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear) for test and example UI
 - [stb\_image\_write](https://github.com/nothings/stb) for writing images to disk

The documentation is generated with [Doxygen](https://doxygen.org/) when the
library is built, provided CMake could find a sufficiently new version of it
during configuration.


## Using GLFW

See the [HTML documentation](https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/) for a tutorial,
guides and the API reference.


## Contributing to GLFW

See the [contribution
guide](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for
more information.

The `master` branch is the stable integration branch and _should_ always compile
and run on all supported platforms.  Details of a newly added feature,
including the public API, may change until it has been included in a release.

The `latest` branch is equivalent to the [highest numbered](https://semver.org/)
release, although it may not always point to the same commit as the tag for that
release.

The `ci` branch is used to trigger continuous integration jobs for code under
testing and should never be relied on for any purpose.


## Reporting bugs

Bugs are reported to our [issue tracker](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues).
Please check the [contribution
guide](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for
information on what to include when reporting a bug.
